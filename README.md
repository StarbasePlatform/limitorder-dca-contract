## Introduction
Starbase Limit Order allows you to set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell a token and a keeper will continue to track the market for a price match. Once matched with the available and sufficient liquidity on the Base network, the order will execute at your desired price. Check our website at https://www.starbase.ag/limit

Instead of risking a large investment at once and potentially buying near a market high, Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) allows you to distribute your investment over time. This method helps to average out your purchase price, thereby lowering your overall cost basis. Check our website at https://www.starbase.ag/dca
